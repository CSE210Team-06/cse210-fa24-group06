### **Mad:** (What needs to be improved)  
- Clearer delegation and identification of tasks.  
- Reemphasis on Development Flow, pipelines, and testing, not just raw code.  
- Need a sense of urgency as the final deadline looms closer.  

---

### **Sad:** (What didn't go well in the sprint)  
- 1:1 communication still tends to be slow.  
- Not as much progress in frontend features as expected.  
- Too much work was handed to one person on the frontend side.  

---

### **Glad:** (What went well in the sprint)  
- Great progress from the backend side of things.  
- Frontend and backend have been integrated successfully for some features.  

---

### **Counter-measures for Mad and Sad:**  
1. Properly decide each personâ€™s work and scope for the next sprint.  
2. Clearly outline required backend endpoints.  
3. Revisit CI/CD pipeline and add code quality checks and automated unit testing.  
4. Ramp up the number of actionables to be completed per person to ensure everything is done beforehand and not at the last minute.  
5. Analyze each actionable in more detail to gauge complexity and assign work accordingly to ensure a fair split of work.
