---

## Mad (What needs to be improved)

- Not everyone was on the same page in terms of what was due when.
- Started a bit late on the coding part.

## Sad (What didn't go well in the sprint)

- Not as much backend progress as expected; no coding yet.
- Concern that other teams might have progressed farther in the same amount of time.
- CI/CD pipelines could have been handled with one person on each end, we might have made it too big of a deal.

## Glad (What went well in the sprint)

- Successfully set up CI/CD for the backend and frontend.
- Defined coding practices and project direction during the meeting.
- Implemented CI/CD in a very short amount of time.
- Made good decisions that enabled learning.

## Counter-measures for Mad and Sad

- Start the sprint early.
- Review deadlines collectively as a team.
- Plan out work for the sprint during the previous week's retrospective.
