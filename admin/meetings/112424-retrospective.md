### **Mad:** (What needs to be improved)  
- Messed up on the details of the auth system implementation.  
- Wasn’t able to implement the frontend as much as expected.  
- Frustrated at myself for panicking and trying to carry the entire frontend team to finish tasks earlier.  
- Many difficulties between frontend and backend aligning on certain issues.  

---

### **Sad:** (What didn't go well in the sprint)  
- Started with a more complex auth approach instead of using a simpler, more established method initially.  
- Progress was slow in implementing the models.  
- Conceptual design was developed fairly late in the process.  

---

### **Glad:** (What went well in the sprint)  
- Held a meeting between frontend and backend teams to clarify request guidelines, which proved beneficial.  
- Improved internal communication within the frontend team.  
- Achieved a functioning, simplified auth system.  
- Developed a conceptual logic to adhere to, which will speed up development in future sprints.

### **Counter-measures for Mad and Sad:**  
1. Plan sprint actionables properly before the sprint begins or during its early stages.  
2. Manage time more effectively.  
3. Delegate tasks more clearly.  
4. Improve communication through measures such as:  
   - Mandatory daily check-ins.  
   - Team members posting their online availability to facilitate coordination.  
   - Introducing additional communication formats due to issues with Mattermost.  
5. Schedule regular meetings/communications (e.g., every 2–3 days) between frontend and backend teams to quickly resolve issues.  
6. Simplify text-based communication (e.g., consistent Mattermost updates) for ongoing alignment.
