## Weekly Standups

Our team conducted weekly standup meetings every Wednesday before our scheduled check-in with our TA, Cora. The standups were structured as follows:

- **Time**: 6:00 PM to 6:30 PM
- **Format**: Scrum-style
  - Team leaders acted as Scrum Masters.
  - Each team member shared their progress, upcoming tasks, and any blockers they faced, all within a 10-minute window.

In addition to the main standup meetings, subteams or pairs working on specific features held their own meetings based on their individual schedules to collaborate and make progress on assigned tasks.
